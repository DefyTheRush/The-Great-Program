# The Great Program
A program that has 3 functions: Generate random numbers, Give advice, Give a chance at fate. Written in Java

Note: 
- Requires JGrasp Version 2.0.4+ because the class file version is 53.0, JGrasp Versions made behind 2.0.4 only recognize up to 52.0
- This was on a repository for my old account on here but I moved it here and deleted it on the old account
